This is a simple JavaScript interface that I am currently producing to fit my own personal needs. It has no demo currently and its in its very early stages.  
Features current or working on:
-Drag and Drop windows (Visual and data)
-Simple(hopefully) sub-Window creation and manipulation(size, location, style, function, collision)
-eMail syntax validation
