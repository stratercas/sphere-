Welcome to William Bowersox's repository!

   For the time being this is being used to house Javascript based projects I am working on. In the future I will use Git to house more general purpose projects that may be useful to others.
   
   Currently I am more focused on web projects based in PHP, Javascript, HTML5, CSS due to its ease of development, however I have worked in C++, VB.NET, XML, and various other languages.
   
   I will not go into a verbose list of platforms or technologies that I have knowledge in as I do not feel that is important. What is important is the projects themselves.

   Currently, my focus is on tools for aiding small businesses as I am attempting to start myself. So, currently I am working for myself but I am interested in other's needs equally.
 
   However, if you see something you like feel free to contact me at william.bowersox@legionauts.com.
